# Calculator Project

A simple yet powerful command-line calculator built with Python. This is my first project as a 2nd year B.Tech CSE AI student.

## About

This calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations as well as some advanced mathematical functions. I built this to practice Python programming and understand how to structure a proper project.

## Features

- Basic Operations
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  
- Advanced Operations
  - Power (x^y)
  - Square Root
  - Modulo
  - Factorial

- Extra Features
  - Calculation History
  - Error Handling
  - User-friendly menu

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher)
2. Download the `calculator.py` file
3. Open terminal/command prompt
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file
5. Run the command:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Usage Example

--- Calculator Menu ---
1 - Add
2 - Subtract
3 - Multiply
4 - Divide
5 - Power
6 - Square Root
7 - Modulo
8 - Factorial
9 - Show History
0 - Exit

What do you want to do? 1
First number: 10
Second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- math module (comes built-in with Python)

## What I Learned

- How to create functions in Python
- Working with user input
- Error handling with try-except
- Using loops and conditionals
- Basic file organization

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add GUI using Tkinter
- [ ] Support for decimal precision settings
- [ ] More scientific functions (sin, cos, tan)
- [ ] Save history to a file
- [ ] Expression evaluation (like "2+3*4")
